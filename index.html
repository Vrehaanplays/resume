    <h3>introduction </h3>
    <p>Hello, I'm Vrehaan, and this is my resume. I am a gamer, developer, YouTuber, and enjoy tinkering with any device I can find. I love jailbreaking devices and experimenting with their capabilities beyond their intended use. Additionally, I enjoy playing pranks on my friends. As of March 28, 2024 (the time of creating this site), I am learning HTML and am about to start learning CSS. My dream is to pursue a triple passion in Formula racing, YouTube content creation, and software development. Feel free to reach out to me at vrehaanplays@gmail.com, and I typically communicate through Discord.</p>
